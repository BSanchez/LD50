Theme is live ! It's "Delay the inevitable".

## Am I pleased ? No.

To be frank, I'd downvoted this one. Everything fit, and the brainstorming session is not doing so
well.

## Definitions

## Brainstorm

### Words and concepts
Decay, the Flood, a magical arrow, a visual novel with a wedding at the end, an infinite runner, an
alien invasion we need to slow, climbing a mountain.

### Some game ideas

Tetris, Hordes, Celeste (the Badeleine pursuit parts), tower defense, top down shooters, downwell.
In fact, every game with a "infinite run mode" would fit.

## Games ideas

### The hero is busy, would you come again tomorrow ?

The final boss is coming for the great battle, but we are not ready. We need to find an excuse for
postpone the battle and grind as much as possible.

### We need to slow down this wedding !

Our sister is currently marrying, but the rice is not ready ! We need to slow down the ceremony
without angering too much our sister, the groom or the priest.

### Death can wait

Death is coming, but we have not finished our favorite show final season ! The player need to find
excuses for making her wait.

## Conclusion

Some things are not so bad, I think ? Let's see with my partner think.
